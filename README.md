Water level has gone down compared with this morning. Passable on bike or in wellies. But there is black ice at the Marston end of the flood as you go around the signs - REALLY slippery! I think will be even more treacherous in the morning. --Dom W|

Audience of spectators on the bridge end. Ice on both ends slippier than it looks. Ice-cold water rushed into the top of my right (ankle-height) boot, but none in my left... make of that what you will & ... --Sam|

You can still walk through in shoes but you will notice if you have a hole in your sole.  --K|
|2023-01-12 08:00|OK (rising)|2.02m||8.446m|[Tweet](https://twitter.com/marstonbikepath/status/1613445555677454337) Passable this morning even by foot, despite river levels rising significantly over night. A couple of feet clear at worst. Suspect it will deteriorate as the day progresses. --|
